  "description": "Japanese strategists planned to occupy Tulagi in the Solomon Islands and Port Moresby in New Guinea as bases to help isolate Australia from the United States. Allied intelligence was able to divine Japanese intentions from intercepted communications, and a carrier task force set out to intercept the Japanese. But in typical Japanese fashion, the over-complicated plan had the backing of powerful carrier forces.",
