  "description": "When Italy entered the war, the British and French reacted quickly, sending their fleets to sea to attack the Italian colonies of Libya and Rhodes. The Italians drew first blood when the submarine Bagnolini sent the cruiser Calypso to the bottom. The Italian surface fleet tried to intercept the Allied forces, but poor air econnaissance prevented contact.",
