  "description": "While Matapan's aftermath cooled the war at sea for several weeks, the land war became hotter than ever on both sides of the Mediterranean. German troops smashed Greek and Commonwealth forces in Greece, and the Royal Navy did its best to evacuate the broken remnants. Meanwhile, Rommel's Afrika Korps punched through the Western Desert Force and drove toward Egypt."
